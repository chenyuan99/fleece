# Fleece — Credit Card Research & Redemption

## Project Overview

**Fleece** is a credit card research and award redemption toolkit. Tagline: "Find the best card for deal saviors."

It has two surfaces:
1. **Streamlit chatbot** (`fleece.py`) — conversational AI assistant backed by OpenAI
2. **CLI** (`cli.py`) — 13 commands for card research, wallet analysis, MCC lookup, spending profile, and award redemption

Published on PyPI as [`fleece-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/fleece-cli/) · current version **0.4.0**

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Chatbot frontend | Streamlit |

| Chatbot memory | ConversationEntityMemory |
| CLI framework | Typer |
| Live research | Brave Search API |
| Card portfolio | SQLite (`fleece.db`) via `db.py` |
| MCC dataset | Bundled `mcc_codes.jsonl` (981 codes, offline) |
| Redemption URLs | `pointsyeah.py` (pure stdlib, no deps) |
| Language | Python 3.11+ |

## CLI Commands

### Research (requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`)
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `fleece card "<name>"` | Full card report — fees, welcome offer, rates, credits, benefits |
| `fleece rates "<name>"` | Earning rates by spend category |
| `fleece partners "<name>"` | Transfer partners, ratios, timing |
| `fleece credits "<name>"` | Statement credits and perks |
| `fleece news "<name>"` | Recent changes (past month, freshness-filtered) |
| `fleece compare "<A>" "<B>"` | Side-by-side comparison |
| `fleece wallet` | Portfolio analysis — coverage, overlaps, gaps, next-card suggestions |
| `fleece roi "<name>"` | First-year ROI estimate by spend profile |
| `fleece recommend "<profile>"` | Card recommendations for a spending profile |

### Redemption & Profile (no API key needed — work fully offline)
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `fleece mcc <code>` | Offline MCC code lookup (981 codes bundled). Add `--wallet` to cross-reference saved cards |
| `fleece flights <ORIGIN> <DEST> --date <YYYY-MM-DD>` | PointsYeah award flight search URL |
| `fleece hotels "<location>" --checkin <date> --checkout <date>` | PointsYeah award hotel search URL |
| `fleece profile show` | Display spending profile |
| `fleece profile set <field> <value>` | Set a profile field |
| `fleece profile unset <field>` | Clear a profile field |
| `fleece profile fields` | List all 10 profile fields |

All commands support `--json` for agent-friendly output and `-` to read arguments from stdin.

### BRAVE_API_KEY
Optional at startup — checked only when a research command actually runs. `mcc`, `flights`, `hotels`, and `profile` work with no key set.

### Spending Profile
Stored in `fleece.db` (table: `profile`). Fields: `dining_monthly`, `groceries_monthly`, `travel_monthly`, `gas_monthly`, `other_monthly`, `annual_fee_tolerance`, `points_programs`, `home_airport`, `goal`, `preferences`.

Once set, profile context is automatically injected into:
- `fleece roi` — pulls spend values when flags not passed
- `fleece wallet` — tailors gap analysis to the user's actual spend
- `fleece recommend` — prepends profile context to the search query
