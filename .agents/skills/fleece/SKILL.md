# Fleece — Credit Card Research & Redemption

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- **Specific cards**: "What are the Amex Gold benefits?", "Is the Chase Sapphire Preferred worth it?", "What changed with the Citi Double Cash?"
- **Earning rates**: "Which card earns the most on dining?", "What's the best card for groceries?"
- **Transfer partners**: "Where can I transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards?", "What airlines does Amex transfer to?"
- **Statement credits**: "How do I use the Amex Gold dining credit?", "What credits does the Venture X have?"
- **Wallet optimization**: "Which card should I use for travel?", "What gaps does my wallet have?"
- **Card recommendations**: "Best travel credit card for beginners", "No annual fee cash back card"
- **ROI / value**: "Is the Amex Platinum worth the $695 fee?", "First-year value of the Sapphire Preferred"
- **Award redemptions**: "Find business class flights JFK to Tokyo", "Search hotels in Paris with points"

Live US credit card data via Brave Search. All commands output JSON for programmatic use.

## Output format

Every command with `--json` returns:
```json
{
  "command": "card",
  "query": "...",
  "result": "...",
  "ok": true,
  "error": null
}
```

On error, `ok` is `false` and `error` contains the message. Always check `ok` before using `result`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Search / tool error (Brave API failure) |
| `2` | `BRAVE_API_KEY` not set |

## Stdin piping

The primary argument on any single-card command accepts `-` to read from stdin:
```bash
echo "Chase Sapphire Preferred" | fleece card - --json
echo "high dining spend" | fleece recommend - --json
```

The `wallet` command accepts `-` as its sole argument to read newline-delimited card names:
```bash
printf "Amex Gold\nChase Freedom Unlimited\nBilt\n" | fleece wallet - --json
```

## Coverage

Supports all major US issuers: Amex, Bank of America, Barclays, Bilt, Capital One,
Chase, Citi, Discover, Robinhood, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo.

## Redemption — PointsYeah URL generation

No API key required. These commands generate best-effort PointsYeah deep-link URLs
and optionally open them in the browser. Pure stdlib, no external calls.

> the query parameters still serve as a useful manual search reference.
