# Fleece — Credit Card Research & Redemption

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- **Specific cards**: "What are the Amex Gold benefits?", "Is the Chase Sapphire Preferred worth it?", "What changed with the Citi Double Cash?"
- **Earning rates**: "Which card earns the most on dining?", "What's the best card for groceries?"
- **Transfer partners**: "Where can I transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards?", "What airlines does Amex transfer to?"
- **Statement credits**: "How do I use the Amex Gold dining credit?", "What credits does the Venture X have?"
- **Wallet optimization**: "Which card should I use for travel?", "What gaps does my wallet have?"
- **Card recommendations**: "Best travel credit card for beginners", "No annual fee cash back card"
- **ROI / value**: "Is the Amex Platinum worth the $695 fee?", "First-year value of the Sapphire Preferred"
- **Award redemptions**: "Find business class flights JFK to Tokyo", "Search hotels in Paris with points"
- **Merchant lookup**: "What card should I use at Costco?", "Which card earns the most at gas stations?", "What MCC is a pharmacy?"
- **Spending profile**: "Set up my profile", "Save my spending habits", "Remember I spend $600/month on dining"

Live US credit card data via Brave Search. All commands output JSON for programmatic use.

## Spending profile

The user's spending profile is stored in `fleece.db` and automatically injected into `fleece wallet`, `fleece roi`, and `fleece recommend`. Set it up once and research commands become personalised.

```bash
# Set profile fields (no API key needed)
fleece profile set dining_monthly 600
fleece profile set travel_monthly 300
fleece profile set groceries_monthly 400
fleece profile set annual_fee_tolerance 550
fleece profile set home_airport JFK
fleece profile set goal "business class to Tokyo 2027"
fleece profile set points_programs "Amex MR, Chase UR"

# View current profile
fleece profile show --json

# List all available fields
fleece profile fields
```

Once set, spend values are pulled automatically:
```bash
# No need to pass --dining or --travel flags
fleece roi "Amex Gold"
fleece recommend "travel rewards"
```

## MCC-enriched workflow

The bundled MCC dataset (981 codes, offline) enables a precise end-to-end flow:

```
fleece wallet            → coverage map, overlaps, gaps, next-card suggestions
fleece mcc 5411          → confirm "Grocery Stores, Supermarkets"
fleece mcc 5411 --wallet → find best card for that exact merchant type
fleece recommend "grocery stores, gas, transit"  → suggest a card to fill the gap
```

**Common MCCs to know:**

| MCC  | Category | Typical card bonus |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| 5411 | Grocery Stores | Amex Gold 4x, BofA Cash Rewards 3% |
| 5812 | Restaurants | Amex Gold 4x, CSP 3x |
| 5814 | Fast Food | Varies — not always same as 5812 |
| 5541 | Gas Stations | Citi Custom Cash 5x, BofA 3% |
| 4511 | Airlines | Amex Platinum 5x, CSR 3x |
| 7011 | Hotels | Amex Platinum 5x (Amex Travel), CSR 3x |
| 4111 | Transit / Commuter | CSR 3x, Bilt 3x |
| 5912 | Drugstores | Chase Freedom Flex 3x |

Use `fleece mcc <code>` (no API key needed) to resolve any MCC before running a rates or wallet query.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install once
pip install fleece-cli

# Set in environment or .env file
export BRAVE_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

## Commands

### Full card report
```bash
fleece card "<card name>" --json
```
Returns fees, welcome offer, earning rates, credits, benefits, and strategy.

### Earning rates
```bash
fleece rates "<card name>" --json
fleece rates "<card name>" --category "<dining|travel|groceries|gas>" --json
```

### Transfer partners
```bash
fleece partners "<card name>" --json
```
Returns airline and hotel partners with ratios and transfer timing.

### Statement credits
```bash
fleece credits "<card name>" --json
```
Returns all credits with amounts, cadence, and enrollment requirements.

### Recent news (past month)
```bash
fleece news "<card name>" --json
```
Freshness-filtered to the past month.

### Side-by-side comparison
```bash
fleece compare "<card A>" "<card B>" --json
fleece compare "<card A>" "<card B>" --aspects "fees,rewards,credits" --json
```

### Portfolio / wallet analysis
```bash
fleece wallet --json
```
Fetches live earning-rate data for every card in the local wallet DB, then
returns structured research for computing a coverage map. Requires BRAVE_API_KEY.

JSON output:
```json
{
  "command": "wallet",
  "cards": ["Amex Gold", "Chase Sapphire Preferred"],
  "research": {
    "Amex Gold": "<snippet>",
    "Chase Sapphire Preferred": "<snippet>"
  },
  "profile": "dining $500/mo, travel $300/mo ...",
  "analysis_prompt": "Using the research above, compute: 1. Category coverage map ...",
  "ok": true,
  "error": null
}
```

Manage the wallet with the `cards` subcommand (no API key needed):
```bash
fleece cards list                              # list saved cards with annual fees
fleece cards add "Chase Sapphire Preferred" --fee "$95"
fleece cards remove "Amex Gold"
```

### First-year ROI
```bash
fleece roi "<card name>" --travel <monthly $> --dining <monthly $> --other <monthly $> --json
```

### Profile-based recommendations
```bash
fleece recommend "<spending profile>" --json
fleece recommend "<spending profile>" --preferences "<preferences>" --json
```

## Output format

Every command with `--json` returns:
```json
{
  "command": "card",
  "query": "...",
  "result": "...",
  "ok": true,
  "error": null
}
```

On error, `ok` is `false` and `error` contains the message. Always check `ok` before using `result`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Search / tool error (Brave API failure) |
| `2` | `BRAVE_API_KEY` not set |

## Stdin piping

The primary argument on any single-card command accepts `-` to read from stdin:
```bash
echo "Chase Sapphire Preferred" | fleece card - --json
echo "high dining spend" | fleece recommend - --json
```

## Coverage

Supports all major US issuers: Amex, Bank of America, Barclays, Bilt, Capital One,
Chase, Citi, Discover, Robinhood, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo.

## Redemption — PointsYeah URL generation

No API key required. These commands generate best-effort PointsYeah deep-link URLs
and optionally open them in the browser. Pure stdlib, no external calls.

### Flight search
```bash
fleece flights JFK LAX --date 2026-06-01 --json
fleece flights JFK LHR --date 2026-06-01 --return 2026-06-15 --adults 2 --cabin business --open
```

Options: `--date` (required), `--return`, `--adults` (default 1), `--cabin` (economy | premium-economy | business | first), `--open`, `--json`

### Hotel search
```bash
fleece hotels "Tokyo" --checkin 2026-06-01 --checkout 2026-06-07 --json
fleece hotels "Jersey City" --checkin 2026-04-10 --checkout 2026-04-12 --guests 2 --rooms 1 --open
```

Options: `--checkin` (required), `--checkout` (required), `--guests` (default 1), `--rooms` (default 1), `--open`, `--json`

### JSON output format
```json
{
  "command": "flights",
  "origin": "JFK", "destination": "LAX", "date": "2026-06-01",
  "return_date": null, "adults": 1, "cabin": "economy",
  "url": "https://www.pointsyeah.com/?type=flights&...",
  "ok": true, "error": null
}
```

> PointsYeah does not publish a stable deep-link spec. If the URL stops working,
> the query parameters still serve as a useful manual search reference.
